# React Movie Search Engine

Hello! I built this React project as part of a one-month "MERN Stack" learning challenge, focusing on mastering React fundamentals through a practical, real-world application.

This repository contains my code, notes, and experiments while learning React by building a fully functional movie search engine. The application integrates with a public API, provides a smooth user experience, and helps reinforce core React concepts.

## Project Overview

This project is a movie search engine built with React. It interacts with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie data. Users can search for movies, view popular titles, and maintain a personal list of their favorite films.

## Course Content and Features

This project helped me learn and practice the following concepts:

### React Fundamentals

- Functional components and JSX syntax
- Props for passing data between components
- State management using `useState`
- Side effects and data fetching with `useEffect`
- Handling user events (form submissions, button clicks)
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys when rendering dynamic data

### Additional Features

- **Popular Movies**: Displays a list of the most popular movies fetched from TMDB.
- **Movie Search**: Allows users to search for movies by title.
- **Favorites List**: Users can add or remove movies from a personal favorites list.
- **Data Persistence**: Favorites are saved using the browserâ€™s local storage.
- **Routing**: Uses React Router for client-side navigation between pages.
- **Global State**: Implements React Context API to share the favorites state across components.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and responsive interface styled using CSS.
- **API Integration**: Works with a real-world public API (TMDB).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **API**: The Movie Database (TMDB)
- **Styling**: CSS
